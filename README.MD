## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS, APIs

The game board is dynamically generated using JavaScript. The categories and answers are pulled in from an [api](https://jservice.io/). Users can generate a new game and the categories are randomly chosen. The user then selects the answer and types the question into the answer input box. The app then tells the user whether they are correct or not but the user can over ride this decision since the answers can be nuanced and still acceptable. Points are then alloted based on the final decision.

## Lessons Learned:

This was the first time I used promise.all so it was a great way to learn how to resolve multiple promises simultaneously.
